The directory structure is as follows.

The zip file contains the raw data of the stimulus sequences reproduced by each participant.
* The six-digit number in each file name is the participant's ID number.
* Each row represents data of each trial.
* r, g, b, and y represent red, green, blue, and yellow, respectively.
* The numbers in the back three columns indicate, from left to right, the generation of the participant, the sequence number, and the accuracy rate.
