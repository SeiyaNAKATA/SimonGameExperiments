This repository contains the scripts to run simulations in

Nakata S, Takezawa M. (in prep.) Hierarchical structures emerge from the cultural transmission: An iterated learning experiment using a non-linguistic task.

The directory structure is as follows. 

<pre>
1_rawdata
├── Exp1
│   ├── individual.zip
│   └── transmission.zip
└── Exp2
    ├── individual.zip
    └── transmission.zip
</pre>

The zip file contains the raw data of the stimulus sequences reproduced by each participant.
* The six-digit number in each file name is the participant's ID number.
* Each row represents data of each trial.
* r, g, b, and y represent red, green, blue, and yellow, respectively.
* The numbers in the back three columns indicate, from left to right, the generation of the participant, the sequence number, and the accuracy rate.
